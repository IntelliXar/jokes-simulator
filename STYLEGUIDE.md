# Style Guide for Joke Simulator App

Here are the style rules and guidelines to follow for maintaining code consistency and readability:

## 1. Code Consistency

Be consistent with the existing codebase. Maintain the same coding style, naming conventions, and folder structure throughout the project.

## 2. Prettier and Linter Rules

Respect the Prettier and linter rules set up in the project. These tools will help automatically format the code and ensure adherence to the style guide.

## 3. File Naming

- Component and class files should follow PascalCase naming convention.
- Other file names should follow camelCase naming convention.
- Component files should have the extension .tsx, while other files should have the extension .ts.

## 4. Google JavaScript Style Guide

The Google JavaScript style guide should be followed for code formatting and best practices. However, if a rule contradicts the existing codebase, rule #1 (Code Consistency) takes precedence.

<!-- ## 5. Grammar Rules

Follow these grammar rules when writing comments and function descriptions:

- Function descriptions should start with a verb using the third person singular.
  - Example: `/** Tests the validity of the input. */`

- Inline comments within procedures should use the imperative form.
  - Example: `// Check whether the value is true.`

- Acronyms should be uppercased in comments.
  - Example: `// IP, DOM, CORS, URL...`
  - Exception: Identity Provider = IdP

- Acronyms should be capitalized (but not uppercased) in variable names.
  - Example: `redirectUrl()`, `signInIdp()`

- Avoid using "login" in comments. Use "sign-in" if it's a noun and "sign in" if it's a verb. Follow the same convention for variable names.
  - Example: `// The sign-in method.`
  - Example: `// Signs in the user.`

- Start an inline comment with a capital letter (unless referring to the name of a variable/function) and end it with a period.
  - Example: `// This is a valid inline comment.` -->

Feel free to refer to this style guide when contributing to the Joke Simulator app. Consistency in coding style and following these guidelines will help maintain a clean and readable codebase.

Happy coding!
